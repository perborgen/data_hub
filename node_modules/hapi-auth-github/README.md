## Why?

We use *GitHub* for ***all*** our coding projects and are building
a tool to keep track of all them: https://github.com/dwyl/tudo

Given that other people will have projects that need GitHub Authentication,  
we have *de-coupled* our OAuth code into this re-useable Hapi Plugin.

##Â *What*?

An easy-to-use Hapi.js plugin that gives you GitHub OAuth Authentication  
in a few simple steps and has *human-readable*, maintained code.

## How?

If you're *new* to GitHub Authentication, and want to *understand* how it works, read the GitHub OAuth Web Application flow:  
https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow

*Or*, if you just need to get up and running *fast*, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Install `hapi-auth-github` from NPM

Install the plugin from npm and save it to your `package.json`:

```sh
npm install hapi-auth-github --save
```

### 2. Create an App on GitHub

Follow the instructions in:
[GITHUB-APP-STEP-BY-STEP-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github/blob/master/GITHUB-APP-STEP-BY-STEP-GUIDE.md)

### 3. Export the *Required* Environment Variables

Once you've created your app following the [*GOOGLE-APP-STEP-BY-STEP-GUIDE*](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github/blob/master/CREATE-GOOGLE-APP-STEP-BY-STEP-GUIDE.md)

Export the Environment Variables:
```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YourAppsClientId.apps.googleusercontent.com
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=SuperSecret
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 # same as Authorized JavaScript Origin
```
We export the two variables prefixed with `GOOGLE_`
to distinguish them from other services you may be using.

The `BASE_URL` is required to know which url your app is using.
it needs to be identical to the `Authorized JavaScript Origin`
that you set in step 2.8 above.

> Note: If you (*or anyone on your team*) are new to
Environment Variables or need a refresher,  
see: [https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-environment-variables**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables)

### 4. Create Your (Custom) Handler Function

This is where you decide what to do with the person's `profile` details  
once they have authorized your App to use Google details.

Your custom handler should have the following signature:
```js
function custom_handler(request, reply, tokens, profile) {
  // save the profile as a session so you can personalize their experience of your app
  // use the reply() to send a response/view to the visitor
}
```
The handler function parameters are:
+ **request** is the hapi request object with all the properties.
+ **reply** is the standard hapi reply object used to send your response to the client or send a rendered view.
+ ***tokens*** are the OAuth2 tokens returned by GitHub for the session
see: [**sample-auth-token.json**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github/blob/master/test/fixtures/sample-auth-token.json)
+ ***profile*** is the person's Google Plus profile
see: [**sample-profile.json**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github/blob/master/test/fixtures/sample-profile.json)

### 5. Register the Plugin into your Hapi.js Server

The final step is to register the plugin into your Hapi.js Server
declaring your desired options:

```js
// declare your desired options for the plugin
var opts = {
  REDIRECT_URL: '/googleauth', // must match google app redirect URI from step 2.8
  handler: require('./google_oauth_handler.js'), // your handler
  scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.profile.emails.read' // ask for their email address
};

server.register([{ register: require('hapi-auth-github'), options:opts }],
 function (err) {
  if(err){
    // handle the error if the plugin failed to load:  
  }
  // the rest of your app ...
});
```

#### `options` *explained*

+ `REDIRECT_URL` - is the url (*endpoint*) where google will
send the initial OAuth2 `code` to check your application is *real*.
Make *sure* that the url is *identical* to the one you defined when
setting up your app on GitHub. e.g: http://localhost:8000/githubauth
(*section 2.2 in the step-by-step guide*)
+ `handler` - the handler you defined above in **step 4**
which is your custom logic for GitHub auth enabled app.
+ `scope` - these are the ***permissions*** your app is requesting.


## Implementation Notes:

To run the example you will need an extra environment variable:
```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YourAppsClientId.apps.googleusercontent.com
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=SuperSecret
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
JWT_SECRET=EverythingisAwesome
PORT=8000
```
